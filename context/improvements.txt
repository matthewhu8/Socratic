perhaps we can have two types: catered lesson smart practice, and also FYP practice

To Do:

YouTube Quiz feature needs "skills_tested" for each question so we can incorporate results 
into student knowledge knowledge_profile

Add images to questions

Smart Learning? FYP/Freestyle? 


Small Fixes:

grading results returned after submit for grading to mobile page, but never displayed to the mobile user
tweak temperatures of the AI model responses for each model in gemini_service

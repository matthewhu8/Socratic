Question Text:
Consider the numbers $4^{n}$, where n is a natural number. Check whether there is any value of n for which $4^{n}$ ends with the digit zero.

Answer: There is no natural number n for which $4^{n}$ ends with the digit zero.

Solution: {
  "introduction": "For a number to end with the digit zero, it must be divisible by 10. This implies that its prime factorization must contain both 2 and 5.",
  "steps": [
    {
      "step_number": 1,
      "heading": "Condition for ending in zero",
      "content": "If $4^n$ were to end with the digit zero, then it would be divisible by 5. That is, the prime factorisation of $4^n$ would contain the prime 5."
    },
    {
      "step_number": 2,
      "heading": "Prime Factorization of $4^n$",
      "content": "This is not possible because the prime factorization of $4^n$ is $4^n=(2)^{2n}$. So the only prime in the factorisation of $4^n$ is 2.",
      "calculation": "$4^n = (2^2)^n = 2^{2n}$"
    },
    {
      "step_number": 3,
      "heading": "Applying the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic",
      "content": "The uniqueness of the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic guarantees that there are no other primes in the factorization of $4^n$ besides 2. Therefore, 5 cannot be a factor of $4^n$."
    },
    {
      "step_number": 4,
      "heading": "Conclusion",
      "content": "Since $4^n$ does not have 5 as a prime factor, there is no natural number n for which $4^n$ ends with the digit zero."
    }
  ],
  "learning_tip": "Remember, the 'uniqueness' aspect of the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic is very powerful! It tells us that a number can only have one set of prime factors.",

Question Text:
Prove that $\sqrt{3}$ is irrational.

Answer: $\sqrt{3}$ is an irrational number.

We can further assume that a and b are coprime (i.e., they have no common factors other than 1) by dividing by any common factors if they exist.",

Prove that $3+2\sqrt{5}$ is irrational.

Answer: $3+2\sqrt{5}$ is an irrational number.

Solution: {

        "solution": "Solution:If the number 4ⁿ, for any n, were to end with the digit zero, then it would be divisible by 5. That is, the prime factorisation of 4ⁿ would contain the prime 5. This is not possible because 4ⁿ = (2)²ⁿ; so the only prime in the factorisation of 4ⁿ is 2. So, the uniqueness of the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic guarantees that there are no other primes in the factorisation of 4ⁿ. So, there is no natural number n for which 4ⁿ ends with the digit zero.",

        "solution": "Solution:We have: 6 = 2¹ × 3¹ and 20 = 2 × 2 × 5 = 2² × 5¹. You can find HCF(6, 20) = 2 and LCM(6, 20) = 2 × 2 × 3 × 5 = 60, as done in your earlier classes. Note that HCF(6, 20) = 2¹ = Product of the smallest power of each common prime factor in the numbers. LCM(6, 20) = 2² × 3¹ × 5¹ = Product of the greatest power of each prime factor, involved in the numbers. From the example above, you might have noticed that HCF(6, 20) × LCM(6, 20) = 6 × 20. In fact, we can verify that for any two positive integers a and b, HCF (a, b) × LCM (a, b) = a × b. We can use this result to find the LCM of two positive integers, if we have already found the HCF of the two positive integers.",

Suppose a and b have a common factor other than 1, then we can divide by the common factor, and assume that a and b are coprime. So, b√3 = a. Squaring on both sides, and rearranging, we get 3b² = a². Therefore, a² is divisible by 3, and by Theorem 1.2, it follows that a is also divisible by 3. So, we can write a = 3c for some integer c. Substituting for a, we get 3b² = 9c², that is, b² = 3c². This means that b² is divisible by 3, and so b is also divisible by 3 (using Theorem 1.2 with p = 3). Therefore, a and b have at least 3 as a common factor. But this contradicts the fact that a and b are coprime. This contradiction has arisen because of our incorrect assumption that √3 is rational. So, we conclude that √3 is irrational.",
